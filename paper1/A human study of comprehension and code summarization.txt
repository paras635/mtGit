   	A Human Study of Comprehension and Code Summarization


An ACM conference was held in may 2020 in seoul, Korea by Sean Stapleten, Yashmeet Gamblir,
Alexender Leclair, Zachary Emberhart, Westley weimer, Kevin Leach and Yu Huang.
Since comments play blear role in  apprehension of programs. Developers find it more
reliable in reading source code while making a software where multiple languages were 
being used yet it has some disadvantage,like outdated, unwanted comments make source code more
difficult for programmers.
For the sake of ease for developers, researchers have developed some unique techniques to
generate automatically summary comments for source code that involves heuritics and templates
to generate comments that more like a natural language.
For the methodoly purpose, they tend to see how the code summaries effect the developer productivity
and by doing that they desiged IRB Approved Human Study involving 45 undergraduate and graduate 
computer science students, and industrial software developers they were asked  to perform
two tasks in an unbaptized online survey.
First they were given methods written in java along with summaries and were asked to answer 
given questions in Second task they were given incomplete java class with summaries and were
asked to complete the method.
Considering time taken and accuracy of answers it would be easy to design a model for developers
where quality summaries would be used.
Human written summaries prove to be more helpful for developers than machine generated 
summaries, but developers cannot still decide which summaries are the most helpful source
A well documented code is known to be beneficial for the  new and experienced developers.
Thus metrics like BLUE and ROGUE were developed for generating automatic code summarization.
